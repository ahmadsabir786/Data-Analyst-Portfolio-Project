### Complete Data Analyst Portfolio Project: Pizza Sales Data üçï

This comprehensive portfolio project showcases the skills of a data analyst through the analysis of pizza sales data. The project involves solving various data-related challenges using MySQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization.

### MySQL Data Processing:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Solves data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies using SQL queries.
2. **Data Aggregation:** Aggregates sales data to derive meaningful insights using SQL aggregation functions.
3. **Data Transformation:** Standardizes data formats and prepares the dataset for analysis using SQL queries.
4. **Performance Analysis:** Identifies best and worst selling products, popular items, and trends using SQL queries.

### Power BI Visualization:
1. **Power Query Editor:** Utilizes Power Query Editor in Power BI to perform data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation tasks similar to MySQL.
2. **Data Modeling:** Designs efficient data models to represent the relationships between different entities in the dataset.
3. **Visualization Dashboard:** Creates an interactive dashboard using Power BI visuals to showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) such as best sellers, worst sellers, best selling days, etc.
4. **Report Generation:** Generates comprehensive reports with visualizations that provide insights into pizza sales performance.

### Handsome Visualization Dashboard:
- **Best Sellers:** Visualizes the top-selling pizza products based on sales volume or revenue.
- **Worst Sellers:** Highlights the least performing pizza products to identify areas for improvement.
- **Best Selling Days:** Illustrates the distribution of sales across different days of the week to identify peak sales days.
- **Trend Analysis:** Presents trends in pizza sales over time using line charts or time series visualizations.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Maps the sales distribution geographically to identify regions with high demand.

### How to Use:
1. Install MySQL and Power BI Desktop if not already installed.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Execute SQL queries provided in the 'MySQL Scripts' folder to clean and process the data in MySQL.
4. Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI Desktop.
5. Use Power Query Editor to perform additional data manipulation and transformation tasks.
6. Design the visualization dashboard using Power BI visuals and publish the report.

### Repository Contents:
- **Data Files:** Contains the original pizza sales dataset.
- **MySQL Scripts:** Includes SQL scripts for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- **Power BI Report:** Contains the Power BI file with the visualization dashboard.
- **Documentation:** Supplementary documentation providing insights into the analysis methodology and visualization techniques.
